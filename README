It consists of 16 cards, with 8 pairs of pictures.

The starts when the user clicks on any of the cards.

At the first click, the card is turned up, i.e the picture becomes visible.

If the pictures are different, both cards are turned face down. 

The game ends when the user has been able to match all the pairs.

When the user finishes the game, the timer stops.

A Reset button allows the user to rstart the game at any time.
